#  FinOps Cloud Cost Optimization & Automation

###  Project Overview
This project automates **cloud cost analysis, anomaly detection, and forecasting** using **Python & FinOps best practices**.  
Instead of using manual Excel processes, I built a **Python-powered pipeline** to uncover inefficiencies and recommend cost optimizations.


### 📊 Business Problem: Why This Matters  
NexaTech Solutions saw a **steady increase in cloud costs** across AWS & Azure. The CFO needed to:  
✅ Identify **which services and departments were driving high costs**  
✅ Detect **unexpected cost spikes and inefficiencies**  
✅ Forecast **future spending trends**  
✅ Provide **data-driven recommendations for cost savings**  



### 🔍 Key Features & Insights  
✔ **Cloud Cost Trends Analysis:** Monthly breakdown of AWS & Azure spending  
✔ **Cost Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unexpected spikes & overspending departments  
✔ **Cloud Cost Forecasting:** Predicts next quarter’s cloud expenses  
✔ **Cost Optimization Strategies:** Rightsizing, Reserved Instances, and Auto-Scaling recommendations  



### 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data analysis & visualization  
- **Time Series Forecasting (Holt-Winters/Prophet)** – Predicting future costs  
- **Anomaly Detection** – Identifying cloud cost spikes  
- **Google Colab & GitHub** – Running and hosting the project

### 🔗 How to Use This Project  
1️⃣ Clone the repo → `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinOps_Cloud_Cost_Optimization.git`  
2️⃣ Open **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**  
3️⃣ Run **`FinOps_Cloud_Analysis.ipynb`** to explore insights  



### **💡 Cost Optimization Recommendations**
1. **Rightsizing:** Reduce underutilized services with high cost but low usage.  
2. **Reserved Instances:** Services with consistent high costs should switch to Reserved Instances.  
3. **Auto-Scaling:** Services with fluctuating demand should use auto-scaling to optimize spending.  


### 🎯 Next Steps & Improvements  
🚀 Automate alerts for sudden cost spikes  
🚀 Integrate with cloud APIs for real-time tracking  
🚀 Expand forecasting models for multi-cloud cost predictions
